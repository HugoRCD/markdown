# markdown

This repository is a collection of markdown snippets that can be used to generate README files for projects.
All of these snippets are currently used accros my GitHub projects, and I decided to centralize them in a single repository to make it easier to maintain and update them.
This is possible thanks to the [automd](https://automd.unjs.io) tool that can fetch markdown snippets from other repositories and update them automatically running `bun run automd`.
